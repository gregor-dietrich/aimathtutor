## Complete Workflow

### For Teachers

1. Log in ‚Üí Admin Panel
2. Create Lessons and Exercises
3. Enable Graspable Math with configuration:
   - Initial expression
   - Target expression
   - Allowed operations
   - Difficulty level
   - Hints
4. Publish exercises

### For Students

1. Log in ‚Üí HomeView
2. Browse lessons and exercises
3. Click "Start Exercise"
4. Work in Graspable Math workspace
5. Receive real-time AI feedback
6. Request hints as needed

---

## Phase 3: Student-Facing Views (CURRENT PRIORITY)

### Goal

Enable students to:

1. Browse lessons and exercises from HomeView
2. Click on an exercise to open ExerciseWorkspaceView
3. Work on the specific problem defined in the exercise
4. Receive AI feedback while working
5. Track progress across multiple exercises

### Required Changes

#### 1. Create ExerciseWorkspaceView (NEW) ‚è≥

**File:** `src/main/java/de/vptr/aimathtutor/view/ExerciseWorkspaceView.java`

Purpose: Display a specific exercise with integrated Graspable Math workspace

Route: `@Route(value = "exercise/:exerciseId", layout = MainLayout.class)`

Features:

- Load exercise by ID from route parameter
- Display exercise title and content
- If `graspableEnabled`, show Graspable Math workspace initialized with exercise config
- If not enabled, show traditional content-only view
- Load Graspable Math configuration from exercise fields:
  - Initial expression
  - Target expression
  - Allowed operations
  - Difficulty level
  - Hints
- Track session with correct exerciseId
- Use existing AITutorService and GraspableMathService
- Real-time AI feedback in sidebar

Base on existing `GraspableMathView.java` but:

- Remove "Generate New Problem" button (problem comes from exercise)
- Load configuration from exercise instead of hardcoding
- Add exercise context to AI prompts

#### 2. Update HomeView ‚è≥

**File:** `src/main/java/de/vptr/aimathtutor/view/HomeView.java`

Current state: Shows GreetService demo

New features:

- Display list of published lessons (LessonService.findPublishedLessons())
- For each lesson, show associated exercises (ExerciseService.findByLessonId())
- Display exercise cards with:
  - Title
  - Preview of content (first 100 chars)
  - "Graspable Math" badge if enabled
  - Difficulty indicator
  - Click handler ‚Üí navigate to ExerciseWorkspaceView
- Grid or card layout for lessons and exercises
- Filter to show only published exercises

Remove:

- GreetService demo code
- Move to more student-focused entry point

#### 3. Navigation Simplification ‚è≥

**File:** `src/main/java/de/vptr/aimathtutor/component/NavigationTabs.java`

Options:

- **Option A (Recommended):** Keep NavigationTabs but simplify:
  - Home
  - Math Workspace (link to standalone practice)
  - (Admin links for admin users)
- **Option B:** Remove NavigationTabs entirely:
  - HomeView becomes primary entry
  - Navigation via exercise cards
  - Admin access via direct URL or header menu

**Decision:** Will implement based on user preference during testing

#### 4. Update GraspableMathService ‚è≥

**File:** `src/main/java/de/vptr/aimathtutor/service/GraspableMathService.java`

Add method:

```java
public String createSessionFromExercise(Long exerciseId, Long userId)
```

- Load exercise configuration
- Create session with exerciseId
- Return sessionId
- Link session to specific exercise for analytics

---

- Show AI feedback
- Mark exercise as complete

Route: `@Route(value = "exercise/:exerciseId", layout = MainLayout.class)`

#### 7. Update HomeView or Create Student Dashboard

**File:** `src/main/java/de/vptr/aimathtutor/view/HomeView.java`

Replace GreetService demo with:

- List of available lessons
- List of exercises per lesson
- Click exercise ‚Üí navigate to ExerciseWorkspaceView
- Show progress (completed exercises)

#### 8. Update ExerciseService

**File:** `src/main/java/de/vptr/aimathtutor/service/ExerciseService.java`

Add methods:

- `findGraspableExercises()` - Get exercises with Graspable Math enabled
- `findExercisesByLesson(lessonId)` - Get exercises for a lesson
- Helper methods to parse JSON fields (hints, operations)

---

## Phase 3: AI Provider Integration (PARALLEL TASK)

### Option A: Google Gemini Flash (FREE TIER) - RECOMMENDED

**Pros:**

- Free tier available (as of Oct 2024)
- Fast response times

3. Implement in `AITutorService.analyzeWithGemini()`
4. Add configuration:

   ```properties
   ai.tutor.gemini.api.key=your-key
   ai.tutor.gemini.model=gemini-1.5-flash
   ```

### Option B: OpenAI (PAID)

- Keep as fallback option
- Premium quality responses

## Questions to Resolve

1. **Gemini Flash Free Tier:**

   - Current limits? (requests per minute/day)
   - Best practices for educational use
   - Fallback strategy if quota exceeded?

2. **Exercise Content Format:**

   - Should `content` field support Markdown?
   - Should we support LaTeX for math notation?
   - How to display complex math in exercise description?

3. **Student Progress:**

   - How to mark an exercise as "completed"?
   - Scoring system? (e.g., based on accuracy, time, hints used)
   - Retry allowed?

4. **Lesson Structure:**
   - Linear progression or free selection?
   - Prerequisites between exercises?
   - Unlock system?

- [ ] `dto/ExerciseDto.java` - Add fields
- [ ] `dto/ExerciseViewDto.java` - Add fields
- [ ] `mariadb.init.sql` - Add columns to posts table
- [ ] `view/admin/AdminExerciseView.java` - Add form fields
- [ ] `view/HomeView.java` - Replace GreetService demo
