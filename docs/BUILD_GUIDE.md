# Build Guide

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: <https://quarkus.io/>.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Requirements

| Name | Build | Run | Download |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| JDK 21 | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?os=any&arch=any&version=21) |
| Maven | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | [Apache](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) |
| Docker | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | (see below) |

For Docker, you have 2 options:

- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- or [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) (includes Docker Engine)

## üîß Setup

Edit `src/main/resources/application.properties` as needed, then run:

```sh
make install   # Installs dependencies, skips tests
```

### üß™ Tests

Run the full test suite:

```sh
make test
```

## üöÄ Running the application

### üßë‚Äçüíª Development mode

```sh
make dev
```

> **_NOTE:_** Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at <http://localhost:9001/q/dev/>.

### üè≠ Production mode

First, package the application for production:

```sh
make build    # Build the JVM Docker image (runs tests/install and Maven package)
```

Then run with Docker Compose:

```sh
docker compose up -d --build
```

## üì¶ Packaging the application

You can package the application using:

```sh
make build
```

It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it‚Äôs not an _√ºber-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _√ºber-jar_, execute the following command:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.jar.type=uber-jar -Pproduction
```

The application, packaged as an _√ºber-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

### üê≥ Creating a Docker image

You can create a Docker image using:

```sh
make build    # Build the JVM Docker image
make release  # Build and push Docker image tag to registry
```

If you want to learn more about building Docker images, please consult <https://quarkus.io/guides/container-image>.
