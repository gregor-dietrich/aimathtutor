# Phase 3 & 4 Complete: Student Views + Gemini AI Integration

## Summary

**Phase 3 (Student-Facing Views)** and **Phase 4 (Gemini AI Integration)** have been successfully completed! The AIMathTutor application now has a complete end-to-end workflow from exercise creation to student interaction with AI-powered feedback.

---

## Phase 3: Student-Facing Views ✅

### 1. ExerciseWorkspaceView (NEW)

**File:** `src/main/java/de/vptr/aimathtutor/view/ExerciseWorkspaceView.java`

**Features:**

- ✅ Route-based navigation: `/exercise/{exerciseId}`
- ✅ Loads exercise from database by ID
- ✅ Validates exercise is published and has Graspable Math enabled
- ✅ Split layout: 70% workspace + 30% feedback panel
- ✅ Embeds Graspable Math with exercise-specific configuration
- ✅ Initializes with `graspableInitialExpression` from exercise
- ✅ Real-time AI feedback on student actions
- ✅ Hint system with progressive revelation
- ✅ Session tracking per exercise
- ✅ "Back to Exercises" navigation button
- ✅ Difficulty badge display
- ✅ Color-coded feedback types (green=positive, red=corrective, blue=hint)
- ✅ Feedback icons (✓, ✗, 💡, 💭, ℹ)

**Student Workflow:**

1. Student clicks "Start Exercise" from HomeView
2. ExerciseWorkspaceView loads with problem pre-configured
3. Student works on problem in Graspable Math canvas
4. Each action triggers JavaScript → Java bridge → AI analysis
5. AI feedback appears in real-time in right panel
6. Student can request hints (tracked and limited)
7. Session data saved to database for analytics

### 2. Updated HomeView

**File:** `src/main/java/de/vptr/aimathtutor/view/HomeView.java`

**Old Behavior:** Showed GreetService demo (hello world)

**New Behavior:**

- ✅ Welcome message with student's username
- ✅ Displays all lessons with their exercises
- ✅ Exercise cards with hover effects
- ✅ "Interactive" badge for Graspable Math exercises
- ✅ Difficulty badges (color-coded)
- ✅ Content preview (first 100 characters)
- ✅ "Start Exercise" button → navigates to ExerciseWorkspaceView
- ✅ Standalone exercises section (exercises not in any lesson)
- ✅ Responsive card-based layout

**Visual Design:**

- Lessons in expandable sections
- Exercise cards in horizontal grid
- Smooth hover animations
- Color-coded difficulty badges
- Clear visual hierarchy

---

## Phase 4: Gemini AI Integration ✅

### 1. GeminiRequestDto & GeminiResponseDto (NEW)

**Files:**

- `src/main/java/de/vptr/aimathtutor/dto/GeminiRequestDto.java`
- `src/main/java/de/vptr/aimathtutor/dto/GeminiResponseDto.java`

**Features:**

- ✅ Complete Gemini REST API request/response structures
- ✅ Support for generation config (temperature, maxTokens)
- ✅ Safety settings configuration
- ✅ Helper methods for creating simple text requests
- ✅ Response parsing with error handling
- ✅ Safety filter detection

### 2. GeminiAIService (NEW)

**File:** `src/main/java/de/vptr/aimathtutor/service/GeminiAIService.java`

**Features:**

- ✅ REST client for Gemini API (no extra dependencies needed!)
- ✅ Configurable via application.properties
- ✅ Reads API key from environment variable (secure)
- ✅ Configurable temperature and max tokens
- ✅ Error handling with detailed logging
- ✅ Safety filter detection
- ✅ Connection reuse for efficiency
- ✅ `isConfigured()` check method

**Configuration:**

```properties
gemini.api.key=${GEMINI_API_KEY:your-api-key-here}
gemini.model=gemini-1.5-flash
gemini.api.base-url=https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta
gemini.temperature=0.7
gemini.max-tokens=1000
```

### 3. Enhanced AITutorService

**File:** `src/main/java/de/vptr/aimathtutor/service/AITutorService.java`

**New Methods:**

- ✅ `analyzeWithGemini(event)` - Main Gemini integration
- ✅ `buildMathTutoringPrompt(event)` - Structured prompt engineering
- ✅ `parseFeedbackFromJSON(response)` - Parse Gemini's JSON response

**Prompt Engineering:**

- Structured prompt with clear guidelines
- Includes student action context (type, before/after expressions, correctness)
- Requests JSON response format
- Guidelines: encouraging, supportive, hint-based (not solution-giving)
- Concise messages (1-2 sentences)

**Fallback Strategy:**

- If Gemini not configured → falls back to mock AI
- If Gemini API error → falls back to mock AI
- If JSON parsing fails → wraps response in simple feedback
- Graceful degradation ensures system always works

**Provider Selection:**

```properties
ai.tutor.provider=gemini  # or 'mock', 'openai', 'ollama'
```

### 4. Documentation

**Files Created:**

- `GEMINI_RESEARCH.md` - Complete research on Gemini 1.5 Flash
- `GEMINI_SETUP.md` - Step-by-step setup guide

**Contents:**

- ✅ How to get API key from Google AI Studio
- ✅ Configuration options (environment variable, properties file)
- ✅ Testing instructions
- ✅ Troubleshooting guide
- ✅ Free tier limits and cost calculator
- ✅ Advanced configuration (temperature, max tokens)
- ✅ Security best practices
- ✅ Support resources

## Complete Workflow

### Teacher Workflow

1. Teacher logs in → Admin Panel
2. Creates a Lesson (e.g., "Introduction to Linear Equations")
3. Creates an Exercise:
   - Title: "Solve 2x + 5 = 15"
   - Content: "Isolate the variable x by performing inverse operations"
   - ✅ Enable Graspable Math
   - Initial Expression: `2x + 5 = 15`
   - Target Expression: `x = 5`
   - Allowed Operations: `simplify, move, subtract, divide`
   - Difficulty: `beginner`
   - Hints:

     ```
     First, move the constant to the right side
     Remember to perform the same operation on both sides
     Divide both sides by the coefficient of x
     ```

4. Publishes exercise
5. Students can now access it from HomeView

### Student Workflow

1. Student logs in → HomeView
2. Sees "Introduction to Linear Equations" lesson
3. Sees exercise card: "Solve 2x + 5 = 15" with "Interactive" and "beginner" badges
4. Clicks "Start Exercise"
5. Workspace opens with problem already set up
6. Student drags and manipulates expressions in Graspable Math
7. Each action:
   - Recorded in database (session tracking)
   - Sent to AI Tutor (Gemini or mock)
   - Feedback displayed in real-time
8. Student can request hints (progressively revealed)
9. When complete, session data saved for teacher analytics
