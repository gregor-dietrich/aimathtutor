# ExerciseWorkspaceView - Graspable Math Update Complete ✅

**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Updated and Ready for Testing

## Changes Applied

### 1. Removed Old Graspable Math Integration
- ❌ Removed `@JavaScript("https://graspablemath.com/shared/libs/gmath/gm-inject.js")` annotation
- ❌ Removed inline JavaScript with old `GraspableMath.Canvas` API
- ❌ Removed old event handling with JSON parsing

### 2. Added New Graspable Math Integration
- ✅ Added `AttachEvent` import
- ✅ Added `onAttach()` method to initialize on view attachment
- ✅ Added `initializeGraspableMath()` method using external JavaScript file
- ✅ Added `registerServerConnector()` for JavaScript-Java bridge
- ✅ Updated `onMathAction()` to use new signature: `(String eventType, String expressionBefore, String expressionAfter)`

### 3. Key Features Preserved
- ✅ Session tracking via `GraspableMathService` (IMPORTANT: this view needs it!)
- ✅ Exercise-specific problem loading from `exercise.graspableInitialExpression`
- ✅ AI feedback integration
- ✅ Hint system
- ✅ Progress tracking

## Code Structure

### Initialization Flow
```
onAttach()
    ↓
initializeGraspableMath()
    ↓
Load /js/graspable-math-init.js
    ↓
Call window.initializeGraspableMath()
    ↓
Wait 1 second
    ↓
Load exercise problem via graspableMathUtils.loadProblem()
    ↓
Register server connector
```

### Event Flow
```
Student manipulates equation
    ↓
JavaScript event listener
    ↓
window.graspableViewConnector.onMathAction(type, before, after)
    ↓
Java @ClientCallable onMathAction()
    ↓
Create GraspableEventDto with:
  - eventType, expressionBefore, expressionAfter
  - studentId, exerciseId, sessionId (tracked!)
    ↓
graspableMathService.processEvent() (session tracking)
    ↓
aiTutorService.analyzeMathAction() (AI feedback)
    ↓
aiTutorService.logInteraction() (logging)
    ↓
displayFeedback() (show in UI)
```

## Differences from GraspableMathView

| Feature | GraspableMathView | ExerciseWorkspaceView |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Purpose** | Free practice | Assigned exercises |
| **Session Tracking** | ❌ None | ✅ Via GraspableMathService |
| **Exercise Link** | ❌ None | ✅ exerciseId required |
| **Problem Source** | AI-generated random | exercise.graspableInitialExpression |
| **Progress Tracking** | ❌ None | ✅ Yes |
| **Use Case** | Exploration | Graded assignments |

## Testing Checklist

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Create an exercise in the database with `graspableEnabled = true`
- [ ] Set `graspableInitialExpression` (e.g., "2x + 5 = 13")
- [ ] Assign exercise to a student

### Tests
- [ ] Navigate to `/exercise/:exerciseId`
- [ ] Canvas loads without errors
- [ ] Exercise equation appears in canvas
- [ ] Dragging terms works correctly
- [ ] Events trigger Java method calls
- [ ] AI feedback appears in feedback panel
- [ ] Session is tracked in database
- [ ] Hints work correctly
- [ ] Exercise completion detection works

## Known Issues / Notes

### Deprecated Method
The old `onMathActionOld(String eventJson)` method is kept as `@Deprecated` for reference but is no longer called by the new JavaScript.

### Timing
- Canvas initialization: 100ms delay
- Problem loading: 1000ms delay (to ensure canvas is ready)
- These delays ensure the canvas is fully initialized before adding content

### Console Logs
You should see in the browser console:
```
[GM] Script loaded
[GM] Script ready
[GM] Starting initialization...
[GM] Loading Graspable Math library (gmath)...
[GM] Library loaded, initializing canvas...
[GM] Initializing canvas...
[GM] gmath API found: [Object]
[GM] Canvas created successfully
[GM] Canvas initialization complete! Ready for problems.
[Exercise] Loading problem: [equation]
[GM] Loading problem: [equation] at 100 50
[GM] Problem loaded: [equation]
```

## What This View Does

`ExerciseWorkspaceView` is for **structured learning** where:
- Teacher creates exercises with specific problems
- Students work on assigned exercises
- Progress is tracked (session management)
- Completion and scores are recorded
- Students can request hints (counted)
- AI provides contextual feedback based on actions

This is different from `GraspableMathView` which is for **free practice** without tracking.

## Next Steps

1. **Test with actual exercise data** - Create exercises in database
2. **Verify session tracking** - Check that events are recorded
3. **Test completion detection** - Ensure exercises can be marked complete
4. **Verify AI feedback** - Check that feedback is relevant to exercise
5. **Test hint system** - Ensure hint count is tracked

## Files Modified
- `/src/main/java/de/vptr/aimathtutor/view/ExerciseWorkspaceView.java`

## Files Reused (Unchanged)
- `/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/js/graspable-math-init.js` (shared with GraspableMathView)

## Architecture Benefits

### Code Reuse ✅
Both views now use the same:
- Graspable Math library (gmath-3.5.13.min.js)
- External JavaScript file (graspable-math-init.js)
- API methods (canvas.model.createElement)
- Event handling pattern

### Maintainability ✅
- One place to fix Graspable Math bugs
- Consistent API usage across views
- Easy to update library version
- Shared utilities in window.graspableMathUtils

### Clear Separation ✅
- GraspableMathView: Practice mode (no tracking)
- ExerciseWorkspaceView: Exercise mode (full tracking)
- Both use same foundation, different features on top

## Conclusion

`ExerciseWorkspaceView` has been successfully updated to use the same working Graspable Math integration as `GraspableMathView`, while maintaining its unique exercise-specific features like session tracking, progress monitoring, and completion detection.

**Status:** ✅ Ready for Testing
