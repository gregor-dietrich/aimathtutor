# TODO

- graspablemathview and exerciseworkspaceview both need a "Complete" state when a problem equals the expectation, so the AI tutor can verify and say something about it
- add different categories to choose from when clicking "generate new problem" rather than always generating a linear equation to solve for x
- add multiple problems per exercise (separated by ; like hints), and when one is complete, enable a newly added button "next problem" (if there are any problems left for the exercise)
- add admin views to track student sessions / ai interactions / student progress in general
- add a settings panel for users to change (their own) password and select the "avatars" (emojis) to display in the ai tutor feedback chat for themselves and the tutor from a dropdown
  - do not allow changing username, email or anything like that for now
