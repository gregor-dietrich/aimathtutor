# AIMathTutor Changelog â€” Version 1.0.0

This is the initial release of AIMathTutor.

## Changelog & Versioning Approach

We follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://www.semver.org), which means each version number reflects the nature of changes:

- **Major**: Breaking changes or significant new features.
- **Minor**: Backwards-compatible improvements or additions.
- **Patch**: Backwards-compatible bug fixes.

Changelogs are maintained in the `changelog/` directory, with a separate file for each version. Each changelog follows [Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), which means:

- Changes are grouped by type (Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security), plus an **Unreleased** section for upcoming changes.
- The **Unreleased** section lets users see what features and fixes are planned for future releases. At release time, these changes are moved into the new version section.
- Entries are written for end users, focusing on what changed, not technical details.
- Every meaningful change is documented before a release.

As this is the initial release, there are no prior changes to list here.
