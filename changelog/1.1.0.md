# AIMathTutor Changelog â€” Version 1.1.0

## Changed

- **Home** renamed to **Lessons** in user-facing navigation tabs.
- UserViewButton icon updated in admin-facing views.
- Grid column widths and flex properties in admin views adjusted for better layout consistency.
- Grid sorting in admin views now consistently orders by newest items first.

## Fixed

- Last login timestamp now updates when a user logs in.
- Columns "Children" in AdminLessonsView and "User Count" in AdminUserGroupsView now update without having to refresh manually (when respective actions are performed).

## Security
